# EFTMoneyEstimate

This script calculates the time it takes to reach the money goal. This is a very simple script based on basic mathematics. 
Therefore the results are not exact. However, it can give a good sense of how long it will take roughly. 
It calculates using 1 minute intervals (LiveCalc), 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 minutes. 
The longer the time period the better the accuracy but also not perfect. 

the requestMaker class needs as parameters url of the website, element type and class name. 
The method getCurent returns the current amount that is still missing as int.

the calculator class needs depending on the calculation a list of values and the current amount that is still missing.

If you have better calculations please let me know or make improvements to this script. This script may be used by everyone.
And if someone makes a website to it even better.
